# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based project that predicts the next-day **Bitcoin price direction** (UP or DOWN) using historical price data and engineered financial features. This project uses real-time data from Yahoo Finance and applies a trained XGBoost classification model for inference.

---

## Project Overview

This project is part of my AI/ML journey, aimed at understanding crypto market trends using supervised learning. It predicts whether Bitcoin's **next-day closing price** will be higher or lower compared to today, based on features engineered from daily OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data.

## Key Features

- Fetches **real-time BTC-USD data** using `yfinance`
- Performs **feature engineering** (e.g., open-close, low-high, quarter-end flag)
- Scales input features using a trained `MinMaxScaler`
- Uses a **pre-trained XGBoost model** for prediction
- Prints output: üìà Open | üìâ Close | üî∫ High | üîª Low | üîÆ Prediction: UP/DOWN

---

##  How It Works

1. Fetch the latest BTC-USD data for 1 day
2. Calculate:
   - `open_close = Close - Open` (daily sentiment)
   - `low_high = High - Low` (volatility)
   - `is_quarter_end = 1 if month in [3, 6, 9, 12] and day > 25 else 0`
3. Scale features using `MinMaxScaler`
4. Make prediction using a trained `XGBoostClassifier`
5. Display the result in human-readable format

## üìä Feature Engineering

| Feature Name     | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `open_close`     | Measures bullish or bearish sentiment         |
| `low_high`       | Indicates daily price volatility              |
| `is_quarter_end` | Flags end-of-quarter market anomalies         |

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python** üêç
- **Scikit-learn** for scaling
- **XGBoost** for classification
- **Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)** for real-time BTC data
- **Pandas, Matplotlib** for EDA (in training phase)
- **Google Colab** for model training and testing
